# KiCad Integration

Konnect uses direct KiCad file editing, KiCad IPC, and `kicad-cli`. The correct
path depends on the operation and whether KiCad currently owns the document.

## Schematic File Editing

Schematic handlers under `crates/konnect-core/src/tools/sch_*.rs` operate on
saved `.kicad_sch` files through `konnect-schematic-editor` and
`konnect-sexp`. These paths work without a running KiCad process and preserve
the embedded library definitions, UUIDs, and instance information needed by
KiCad.

Existing-file writes use the atomic/conflict-aware machinery in
`konnect-sexp/src/writer.rs`. Multi-file changes use
`konnect-sexp/src/transaction.rs`; a source revision change must become a
conflict rather than an overwrite.

## KiCad IPC

`crates/konnect-ipc` sends typed protobuf requests over NNG. The socket comes
from `ipc_address`, then `KICAD_API_SOCKET`, then discovery of KiCad's default
endpoint by `konnect-ipc/src/socket.rs`; KiCad-provided credentials such as
`KICAD_API_TOKEN` are carried in the IPC client request metadata.

Discovery is per-platform because the endpoint is: a Unix socket is a
filesystem entry whose metadata is read and whose owner must be this user,
while NNG's `ipc://` on Windows is a named pipe with no filesystem presence, so
the candidate path is looked up in the pipe namespace instead. Neither branch
opens the endpoint — a stream connect that does not complete NNG's handshake
wedges KiCad's server for every client (#498), and on Windows opening the pipe
would also consume a server instance. Liveness stays the job of the bounded
`Ping` in `client.rs`.

The three board-write gates are:

- `KiCadIpcClient::ensure_board_is_active` in `konnect-ipc/src/client.rs`
  prevents a request naming one board from changing another open board.
- `attempt_ipc_write` in `konnect-core/src/tools/pcb_board.rs` permits a file
  fallback only when IPC is unreachable. A response from KiCad, including a
  rejection, fails closed.
- `refuse_if_board_open_in_kicad` in the same module protects file-only tools
  from edits KiCad would discard on its next save.

Closed-board move, rotate, and flip in `tools/pcb_components.rs` are narrowly
scoped exceptions with explicit geometry checks. They are not a general license
to edit a live board file.

`flip_component` on an *open* board no longer falls into that closed-board
exception: KiCad 10.0.6 added a native `FlipItems` IPC command, so
`handle_flip_component` drives it through `attempt_ipc_write` like the other
live-preferred-with-fallback tools, using the same `FlipItems`-transform KiCad's
own **F** key applies (including the footprint's 3D-model offset/rotation).
Older or unsupported KiCad answers `AS_UNHANDLED`, which is reported as a
structured `unsupported_capability` result rather than falling back to editing
the file — the file fallback only ever fires when no live KiCad holds the named
board at all. The closed-board file-fallback path is unchanged and keeps
refusing any footprint whose 3D model has a non-zero `offset.y`/`rotate.x`/
`rotate.y`, since reproducing KiCad's own 3D-model flip math for that path
remains out of scope (issue #604). It mirrors inner copper through the board's
`(layers …)` table as KiCad's `FlipLayer` does, refuses per-layer padstacks, and
returns `plan_blocked` for an inner layer the board lacks (#831).

### Editor observation

`konnect-ipc::KiCadIpcClient::observe_editor_state` queries the running KiCad
version and schematic/PCB `GetOpenDocuments` surfaces on the configured
endpoint. `tools/editor_navigation.rs` exposes that typed observation through
the provisional `editor_navigation` toolset while design issue #395 is under
review.

The observation preserves project and `DocumentSpecifier` sheet/board identity
and labels its evidence as live IPC. KiCad 10 has no stable typed query for the
foreground frame, active document, or active schematic sheet, so those fields
remain unavailable; Konnect does not infer active state from open-document
order. The same capability record reports stable typed activation and reveal
as unsupported rather than routing callers through arbitrary `RunAction`
strings.

`KiCadIpcClient::observe_selection` accepts one exact editor/document identity
from that observation, matches it before issuing `GetSelection`, and repeats
the open-document read afterward because KiCad's `SelectionResponse` carries
no response header. Every returned item is dispatched by its full protobuf
type URL and must contain a non-empty KIID; an unknown or malformed selected
item fails the entire observation rather than being dropped. The vendored
schematic protobuf currently decodes line and label selections. Schematic
symbols and other unmodelled types remain explicitly unsupported until KiCad
provides stable typed serialization for them.

Navigation target resolution keeps two evidence channels in the same result
without merging them. `GetOpenDocuments` proves that the exact requested live
project/document/sheet context is still addressable; the saved `.kicad_sch` or
`.kicad_pcb` structure proves object KIID and human-reference identity. Stable
KIID lookup is primary. A reference such as `C10` is accepted only when one
object matches in the exact document and sheet instance; duplicates return
structured candidates, and stale project ownership or symbol-instance paths
fail closed before any editor mutation.

Selection mutation uses KiCad's typed `ClearSelection`, `AddToSelection`, and
`RemoveFromSelection` commands only after every non-clear KIID resolves in the
explicit saved project/document/sheet. The transport response is not treated
as success: Konnect performs a fresh exact-context `GetSelection`, compares the
entire observed set with the expected before/after transition, and returns a
structured `readback_mismatch` if KiCad did not make precisely that change.
Duplicate or empty KIID requests are rejected before IPC.

`resolve_cross_probe_target` maps an exact schematic symbol to its PCB
footprint, or the footprint back to the symbol, from KiCad's saved footprint
symbol-path linkage. It requires the explicit project, both saved documents,
the schematic hierarchy instance, and the source KIID; reference agreement is
checked as an additional consistency guard. Both requested editor documents
must also be proven open through typed `GetOpenDocuments` readback. Missing,
duplicate, malformed, or instance-inconsistent links return a structured
`unresolved_cross_probe_destination` instead of guessing. The operation is
resolve-only: it does not activate an editor or mutate selection, and pin/pad/
net expansion remains unsupported until one stable destination can be proven.

## Schematic-To-Board Sync

`update_pcb_from_schematic` in `tools/pcb_sync.rs` is live-IPC-only. It uses
`tools/cli.rs` to export a netlist from the saved hierarchy, plans against a live
snapshot, requires the current plan revision for apply, performs one IPC commit,
and reads the affected footprint shapes back.

The read-back is a correctness boundary, not merely a diagnostic convenience.
In earlier releases, protobuf `Any` values carrying footprint graphics decoded
as empty pads because unknown proto fields are skipped; KiCad accepted the
mutation. The v0.7 path discriminates the declared type and verifies the board
after commit.

## `kicad-cli`

`crates/konnect-core/src/tools/cli.rs` is the shared subprocess and result parser
for ERC, DRC, exports, and rendering. Callers should use it rather than build
ad-hoc command lines.

The DRC result model preserves design-rule violations, unconnected items, and
schematic parity. `verification.rs`, `pcb_export.rs`, `design_review.rs`, and
`manufacturing.rs` consume that complete result; unavailable categories or a
failed CLI run cannot be treated as a clean board. Parity is opt-in on the
kicad-cli side (`--schematic-parity`), so `run_drc` always requests it; and
because KiCad writes an empty parity array — while stating on stderr that it
failed to fetch the schematic netlist — when the board's project has no root
schematic, `run_drc` reads that statement and reports the category as
unchecked, with a diagnostic naming the root it would have read, rather than
as zero. A non-empty parity array is kept as KiCad's evidence regardless.

Konnect's Freerouting bridge keeps the KiCad and routing responsibilities
separate: `export_specctra_dsn` snapshots the live board and writes a
revision-bound DSN job, `route_specctra_dsn` drives the discovered local JAR
through Freerouting's native headless MCP server, and
`plan_specctra_ses_import` / `apply_specctra_ses` validate and apply the result
through one KiCad undo transaction. Board data stays local, output files are
created without replacement, and the Freerouting child process is bounded and
owned by Konnect.

On KiCad 10, `export_specctra_dsn` can optionally use the legacy Python
ActionPlugin as a deliberately narrow native-export bridge. The plugin calls
KiCad's own `pcbnew.ExportSpecctraDSN` on the UI thread and returns a
plugin-owned temporary file over an authenticated loopback endpoint. Rust
still captures the immutable IPC snapshot, rejects a board revision change,
checks that the native DSN has the same components, pads, nets, layers, and
routing rules, and writes the revision-bound reverse manifest. The temporary
file is consumed and deleted.

The `native_bridge_mode` tool argument controls selection: `prefer` (the default)
uses a running bridge and otherwise falls back to the Rust DSN exporter,
`require` fails if native export cannot be used, and `disable` uses Rust only.
Native export is disabled in the plugin settings by default. This bridge is a
KiCad 10 compatibility path, not a substitute for the executable IPC plugin or
the KiCad 11 architecture; strict SES planning and atomic IPC apply never pass
through Python.

## Configuration

Konnect selects the first existing server configuration file in the order below
and loads only that file. It does not merge settings from later locations. Call
`get_installation_info` to see which file configured the running process and
which later files were shadowed.

So a value present only in a lower-priority file has no effect while a
higher-priority file exists.

1. `konnect.toml` in the working directory;
2. `settings.json` in the working directory;
3. `settings.json` beside the executable;
4. `settings.json` one directory above the executable;
5. the platform configuration directory.

Two consequences worth stating outright, because both have been reported as
missing functionality:

- In the standard plugin layout a `settings.json` exists beside the binary, so
  the platform configuration directory is never reached and any `config.toml`
  there is inert.
- A stray `konnect.toml` or `settings.json` in a working directory takes over the
  entire configuration for that run.

Call **`get_installation_info`** to see which file configured the running
process: its `configuration` block reports `source`
(`explicit_path` | `search_path` | `defaults`), the absolute `selected_path`, the
`search_policy`, and `skipped_existing_paths` — the later files that exist and
were shadowed. The values are captured at startup, so a file created afterwards
is not reported. The server also logs one INFO line naming the selection at
startup, for when no tool call is possible yet.

Note that `load_user_config` is a different plane: it reads a user
design-preferences file (`config.json`), not the server startup configuration
described here, so its path does not answer "which file configured the server".

`--config <path>` loads an explicit file and bypasses the search entirely; the
list above is not consulted, and `get_installation_info` reports
`source: "explicit_path"` with no skipped candidates. Relevant fields include `kicad_cli`,
`kicad_binary`, `ipc_address`, `transport`, `http_address`, `jlcpcb_db_path`,
`log_level`, `auto_load_toolsets`, and `eager_toolsets`. The legacy
`ipc_socket_path` alias is accepted by the serde definition in `config.rs`.

A blank or whitespace-only configured `jlcpcb_db_path` means unset for all
JLCPCB database tools. They use the platform default (`%APPDATA%/konnect/jlcpcb.db`
on Windows, `$HOME/.konnect/jlcpcb.db` elsewhere) unless a nonblank configured
path is supplied. Nonblank configured paths are preserved without trimming;
the download tool's per-call `output_path` takes precedence. This normalization does not rewrite
your settings file or download a database at startup.

## Plugin, Viewer, And Packaging

`plugin` contains the legacy KiCad 10 Python ActionPlugin for settings/server
control and the optional native Specctra bridge. `plugin.json` declares the
separate executable IPC integration that is the forward path. The standalone viewer in
`crates/schematic-viewer` watches schematic files and renders through
`kicad-cli`; it is built and tested separately from the Rust workspace.

The PCM assembly scripts in `packaging/build-pcm.ps1` and `build-pcm.sh` stage
only metadata, plugin files, icons, and binaries. Repository developer
documentation under `docs/` is intentionally not part of the install zip.
