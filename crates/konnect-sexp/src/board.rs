//! Structural queries over a `.kicad_pcb` tree.
//!
//! These exist because `SexpNode::find_all` is **direct children only**, which
//! is easy to forget: `footprint`, `segment`, `via` and `net` *are* direct
//! children of `(kicad_pcb …)`, so `tree.find_all("footprint")` is right — and
//! `pad` is not, so `tree.find_all("pad")` silently returns 0 on every board
//! ever written. Design review reported `pads: 0` for the whole life of its
//! coverage block because of exactly that (#246).
//!
//! # Malformed-item policy
//!
//! A copper item missing a load-bearing field (a segment without an endpoint,
//! a via without a drill) is **skipped and counted**, never fabricated: a
//! coordinate defaulted to 0.0 places phantom copper at the board origin and
//! everything downstream — placement, test-point selection, voltage drop —
//! computes confidently from it. Every scan therefore returns a [`Scan`]
//! carrying the parsed items *and* how many matching nodes were dropped, so a
//! caller can refuse to trust a board that lost items rather than never
//! finding out.
//!
//! # Net identity
//!
//! Items name their net two ways depending on the file format (see
//! [`crate::net`]): KiCad 10 writes `(net "GND")` in place; KiCad ≤ 9 writes
//! `(net 2)` and declares `(net 2 "GND")` once at top level. The scans here
//! resolve both to the net **name**, using the board's own top-level table for
//! the numeric form, so the same physical net gets the same key whichever
//! format wrote the file. The unconnected pseudo-net (net 0 / the empty name)
//! resolves to `None` — copper with no net is a real state, not a net called
//! `""`.
