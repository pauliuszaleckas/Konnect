//! `score_placement` — the objective judge for footprint placement.
//!
//! The metric lands before any placer exists on purpose: every placement
//! algorithm that follows gets scored by the same referee it did not write.
//!
//! # Verdict vs. score
//!
//! The numeric score is advisory; the verdict is not. **Hard failures** —
//! same-side courtyard-bbox overlaps and parts outside the board outline —
//! decide the verdict no matter what the number says, because a board with
//! two parts in the same physical space is unbuildable at any score. A board
//! with no Edge.Cuts outline cannot be judged "inside", so it can never pass:
//! the response says `outline_missing` explicitly rather than skipping the
//! check silently.
//!
//! # Weight table
//!
//! The soft-score weights (overlaps ×20 capped 40, outside ×20 capped 40,
//! connector-edge ×15 capped 30, decoupling ×15 capped 30) are ported from
//! the MIT-licensed reference implementation attributed in THIRD_PARTY.md.
//!
//! Every response field is derived from the parsed board — never echoed from
//! the request (the recurring defect class this repo pins tests against).
