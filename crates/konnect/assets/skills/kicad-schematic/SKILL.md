# KiCAD Schematic Design Workflow

This skill guides Claude to design schematics using Konnect MCP tools.
ALL modifications go through MCP tools — never edit .kicad_sch files directly.

---

## Toolset Loading

Before any schematic work, load the required toolsets:

```
load_toolset('sch_components')   # place, move, rotate, delete symbols
load_toolset('sch_wiring')       # wires, net labels, power symbols, connections
load_toolset('sch_analysis')     # connection validation, short and orphan checks
load_toolset('sch_export')       # direct ERC and rendered schematic evidence
load_toolset('project')          # save_project before formal checks
```

Load additional toolsets as needed:

```
load_toolset('library')          # search_symbols, get_symbol_info, list_symbol_libraries
load_toolset('sch_batch')        # batch operations for 3+ items
```

Always call `get_active_toolsets()` first to see what is already loaded.

---

## Component Placement

Read [`references/common-lib-ids.md`](references/common-lib-ids.md) when choosing
a common generic KiCad symbol. It is a quick-start index, not an allowlist;
search the active libraries when the required part is absent or package-specific.

### Workflow

1. Search the library first: use `search_symbols` to find the correct lib_id
2. Get pin info: use `get_symbol_info` to see pin names, numbers, and positions
3. Place on the 1.27mm grid (KiCAD default schematic grid)
4. Verify placement with `list_schematic_components`

### Package-sensitive and custom parts

Before placing or wiring a custom symbol, a manufacturer-specific discrete,
or any package whose view can be mirrored, require the `kicad-library` skill's
**accepted physical pin map** for the exact MPN and package suffix. The map must
join each datasheet lead to the symbol pin and footprint pad, identify the
drawing view/direction, reconcile duplicate and mechanical pads, and include
query-back plus disposable rendered inspection. `get_symbol_info` proves the
library data that exists; it does not prove that data matches the package.

If the accepted physical pin map is missing, incomplete, based on a different
suffix, or ambiguous about top/bottom/mating view, stop before real schematic
placement. Do not infer physical numbering from a generic symbol name or from
the order pins appear on screen.

### Common Library IDs

| Component       | lib_id                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Resistor        | `Device:R`                     |
| Capacitor       | `Device:C`                     |
| Capacitor Polar | `Device:C_Polarized`           |
| Inductor        | `Device:L`                     |
| LED             | `Device:LED`                   |
| Diode           | `Device:D`                     |
| Zener           | `Device:D_Zener`               |
| NPN Transistor  | `Transistor_BJT:Q_NPN_BEC`     |
| PNP Transistor  | `Transistor_BJT:Q_PNP_BEC`     |
| N-MOSFET        | `Transistor_FET:Q_NMOS_GDS`    |
| P-MOSFET        | `Transistor_FET:Q_PMOS_GDS`    |
| 2-pin Connector | `Connector_Generic:Conn_01x02` |
| 4-pin Connector | `Connector_Generic:Conn_01x04` |
| Ground          | `power:GND`                    |
| +3.3V           | `power:+3V3`                   |
| +5V             | `power:+5V`                    |
| VCC             | `power:VCC`                    |
| VDD             | `power:VDD`                    |

### Rotation Conventions

- 0 degrees: default orientation (pins left/right)
- 90 degrees: rotated CCW (useful for vertical components)
- 180 degrees: flipped horizontally
- 270 degrees: rotated CW

Power symbols: GND uses 0 (arrow points down), VCC/VDD/+3V3/+5V use 0 (arrow points up).

### Spacing Guidelines

- Between ICs: 30-50mm horizontal, 20-30mm vertical
- Between passive components: 10-15mm
- Between a decoupling cap and its IC: 5-10mm
- Leave room for wiring: minimum 5mm between component pins and other elements

## Wiring

Read [`references/wiring-patterns.md`](references/wiring-patterns.md) when
choosing between direct wires and labels or when building one of its common
subcircuits. Verify every named pin against the placed symbol before applying a
pattern.

### Connection Methods — Decision Table

| Scenario                                | Method                  | Why                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Two pins physically close (<30mm)       | `connect_pins`          | Direct wire, auto-routed                 |
| Named signal (SDA, MOSI, EN, etc.)      | `connect_to_net`        | Stub wire + net label, cleaner           |
| Power rail (VCC, GND, +3V3)             | `add_power_symbol`      | Proper power symbol, global net          |
| Rail on several nearby pins            | `batch_add_power_symbol` | One bar and one symbol per row of pins  |
| Bus signals (D0-D7)                     | `connect_to_net`        | Net labels with bus naming               |
| Cross-sheet signal                      | Global label            | Connects across schematic sheets         |
| Multiple pins to same net (3+)          | `batch_connect_to_net`  | Efficient bulk operation                 |

### connect_pins

Use for direct pin-to-pin connections. The tool auto-routes with L-bends.

```
connect_pins(schematic, ref1, pin1, ref2, pin2)
```

- Specify pins by pin number (from get_schematic_pin_locations)
- Works best when pins are nearby and facing each other
- Automatically creates wire segments with proper bends

### connect_to_net

Use for named nets. Creates a short stub wire and attaches a net label.

```
connect_to_net(schematic, reference, pin_number, net)
```

- Preferred for signals that connect to 3+ pins
- Preferred for named buses and control signals
- Keeps schematic clean and readable
- Net name must be consistent across all connections
- Name the pin rather than passing `pin_x`/`pin_y`: the stub then points away
  from the symbol body on its own, instead of the label text running back
  across the pin names. Override with `direction` only to fix a layout clash.
- `batch_connect_to_net` does the same for many pins in one read/write. By
  default it places its labels directly on the pin endpoints without stubs;
  pass `stub_length`, `direction` and `label_type` for `connect_to_net`'s
  layout on every pin in the call.
- Placing a label by hand with `add_schematic_net_label` instead? Take its
  rotation from `orientation_degrees` in `get_schematic_pin_locations`, or the
  text reads back across the symbol's pin names.
- These labels are sheet-local. In a sheet placed more than once, each instance
  gets its own independent copy of the net — right for per-instance signals,
  wrong for a rail every instance must share. A shared rail takes
  `add_power_symbol` or `add_schematic_net_label` with
  `label_type: global_label`; both are one net across all sheets and instances.

### add_power_symbol

Use for all power connections, in preference to labelling a pin with the rail name.
The one exception is a rail that must stay separate per instance of a repeated
sheet — see below.

```
add_power_symbol(schematic, power_net, reference, pin_number, rotation?)
add_power_symbol(schematic, power_net, x, y, rotation?)
```

- Name the pin with `reference` + `pin_number`. The symbol lands on that pin's
  endpoint and, without `rotation`, faces away from the body: GND below a
  downward pin, turned sideways on a sideways pin. A missing pin, or a
  reference two placed symbols share, is refused and nothing is written.
- Or give `x` + `y`, never both forms. Coordinates snap to the 1.27mm grid,
  like every other placer, and `rotation` defaults to 0. The response reports
  where the symbol landed.
- `power_net` is loaded as `power:<power_net>`, so it must name a symbol in
  KiCad's power library: `+3V3` and `+12V`, never `3V3` or `12V`. A miss is an
  error and nothing is placed.
- `rotation` defaults to 0 — see Rotation Conventions above.
- A power pin landing mid-segment on a wire gets its junction dot
  automatically, in either order: symbol onto an existing wire, or a wire
  routed across an already-placed symbol.
- Power symbols are global: every `+5V` symbol on every sheet, and in every
  instance of a sheet, joins one `+5V` net. A rail that must stay separate per
  instance of a repeated sheet (each node's own 5V, say) takes a local net
  label via `connect_to_net` instead — `power:+5V` there shorts all the
  instances' rails together.
- A pin already on `power_net` gets no second symbol. The response is
  `already_connected: true` with `existing_reference`, and nothing is written.
  This holds whether the existing symbol sits on the pin or is reached through
  a wire, and it covers stacked pins such as an MCU's VSS pins.

### batch_add_power_symbol

Use when several pins go to one rail: the supply or ground pins along one edge
of an IC, or the pins of a row of decoupling caps. Make one call per rail. It is
in the `sch_batch` toolset.

```
batch_add_power_symbol(schematic, power_net, pins: [{reference, pin_number}], max_gap?, stub_length?)
```

- Pins that face the same way, end on one row and sit within `max_gap`
  (default 10.16 mm) of a neighbour are joined by a stub each (`stub_length`,
  default 2.54 mm) and a bar, with one power symbol on the bar. Other pins get
  a symbol on their endpoint.
- A group whose wires would touch another pin, wire, label or junction is not
  joined. Each of its pins gets its own symbol, and `not_joined_reason` says
  what was in the way. Move parts apart and retry if the bar matters.
- Pins already on the rail are listed under `already_connected` and skipped.
- A pin that cannot be resolved refuses the whole call before anything is
  written.

## Batch Operations

Load `sch_batch` toolset when placing 3 or more components or making bulk connections.

### batch_place_components

Place multiple components in one call. Provide `schematic` and a `components` array of `{lib_id, x, y, rotation?, reference?, value?, unit?}` objects. Pass `reference` explicitly for each component -- it is not auto-assigned.

The batch commits all symbols once, then reconciles every new pin endpoint in
that same atomic write. Check the "junctions_added_count" and
"junctions_pruned_count" response fields; a pin placed mid-segment on an
existing wire is not electrically connected in KiCad unless the required
junction was added.

### batch_connect_to_net

Connect multiple pins to the same net in one call. Ideal for:
- Connecting all VCC pins on an IC
- Connecting all GND pins
- Bus signals across multiple ICs

### batch_edit_schematic_components

Bulk-modify component properties (values, footprints, fields) across multiple components.
The default remains update-only. Set `create_missing: true` to create a missing
custom field on every placed unit of each named component. `Reference`, `Value`,
`Footprint` and `Datasheet` are never created through this option; use the
dedicated arguments or workflows for built-in fields. Inspect each result's
“updated_units” and “created_units” counts, because a partially populated
multi-unit component can report both.

### When to Use Batch vs Individual

- 1-2 components: individual calls
- 3+ components: batch operations
- Mixed operations (place + wire): do placement batch first, then wiring batch

---

## Common Patterns

### Decoupling Capacitor
Place 100nF cap (Device:C) within 5mm of IC power pin. Connect one pin to VCC via power symbol, other pin to GND via power symbol. One cap per VCC/VDD pin.

### Pull-up Resistor
Place resistor (Device:R) vertically. Connect one pin to the signal net via `connect_to_net`, other pin to VCC via `add_power_symbol`. Typical values: 4.7k for I2C, 10k for general.

### Voltage Divider
Two resistors in series, vertically aligned. Top to input net, middle junction to output net, bottom to GND. Use `connect_to_net` for input/output, `add_power_symbol` for GND.

### LED with Current-Limiting Resistor
Resistor in series with LED. Connect resistor to signal/power, resistor to LED anode, LED cathode to GND. R = (Vsupply - Vf) / If. Typical: 330R for 3.3V, 470R for 5V.

### Bypass/Decoupling Filter
For analog circuits: 100nF ceramic + 10uF electrolytic in parallel, close to power pins. Place ceramic closest to IC.

### Crystal Oscillator
Crystal (Device:Crystal) between XI and XO pins. Two load capacitors from each crystal pin to GND. Typical load caps: 12-22pF. Optional 1M feedback resistor across crystal.

## Post-Placement Verification

After placing components and wiring, always run these checks:

### annotate_schematic
Numbers `?` designators the way eeschema's Tools → Annotate does (ascending X, first free number in the project, numbers reserved across every sheet instance in the file) and writes both places a designator lives. The units of one multi-unit part get one shared designator. Duplicated designators are **reported, not fixed**: read `unresolved` and the `outcome` — `partial` means the schematic still has a conflict — and pass `resolve_duplicates: true` to renumber all but the first of each group of separate parts; a shared designator that could be the units of one package is never renumbered, so fix those by hand. It annotates one project's instance records (the schematic's owner, or `project`) and never edits another project's; numbers used on the project's other sheets are reserved through its sheet tree (the response lists the sheets it consulted), but duplicates already spread across sheets are not detected, so annotate each sheet and then run `run_erc`. Run after all placement is complete; `dry_run: true` shows the plan first.

### validate_wire_connections
Checks that all wires connect properly to pins. Reports:
- Dangling wire ends
- Wires that miss pins
- Overlapping wires

### validate_component_connections
Verifies that components have the expected connections. Reports:
- Unconnected pins that should be connected
- Missing power connections

### find_orphan_items
Finds floating wires, labels, and symbols that are not connected to anything.

### Verification Workflow

1. Place and wire complete functional blocks.
2. Run `annotate_schematic`, then save with `save_project`.
3. Run `validate_wire_connections` and `validate_component_connections`.
4. Run `find_shorted_nets`; reconcile each finding against the intended nets.
5. Run `find_orphan_items` as a heuristic and corroborate its findings.
6. Run direct KiCad ERC with `run_erc` and classify every violation.
7. Run `render_schematic_png` with inline output and inspect the actual image.
8. Fix findings and repeat every check invalidated by the edits.

---

## Visual feedback loop

The agent can see its own schematic. After meaningful edits:

1. `render_schematic_png` — rasterize the sheet (pass `inline` true to get
   the image back as base64 and actually look at it).
2. `set_visual_baseline` — capture the known-good render before a batch of
   edits (stored under the project's own state directory with the source
   hash and renderer identity).
3. `compare_visual_baseline` — after edits: PASS/DRIFT against a 2% content
   threshold with the changed region's bounding box. "No baseline stored" is
   a normal state, and a baseline from an older renderer is flagged rather
   than silently trusted.

Use the loop to catch what connectivity checks cannot. Completion requires
coherent functional grouping, label-inclusive overlap inspection, clear signal
flow, and page-boundary acceptance for every symbol, label, and note. Inspect
the image itself; a successful render command is not visual acceptance.

## Evidence and completion gate

Apply this order when evidence disagrees:

1. Exact requirements and manufacturer datasheets.
2. Direct KiCad ERC and saved/exported connectivity.
3. Direct net, short, pin, and component evidence from Konnect.
4. Aggregate review results.
5. Heuristic orphan, single-pin, decoupling, and best-practice findings.

A weaker heuristic may raise a question but does not override stronger direct
evidence. If any required check did not run, failed structurally, returned
impossible coverage, or contradicts stronger evidence without resolution, the
result is `INCOMPLETE`. Report the blocked evidence and stop short of a clean or
production-ready claim.

## Rules

1. **Never edit .kicad_sch files directly** — all changes go through MCP tools
2. **Never guess pin numbers** — always use `get_schematic_pin_locations` or `get_symbol_info` to look up pin numbers before connecting
3. **Always verify after changes** — run validation tools after placing and wiring
4. **Use the grid** — all placements on 1.27mm grid
5. **Search before placing** — use `search_symbols` to confirm lib_id exists
6. **Power symbols for power** — use `add_power_symbol` for rails, not net labels; the exception is a rail that must stay separate per instance of a repeated sheet, which takes a local label because power symbols are global
7. **Net labels for named signals** — keeps schematics readable
8. **Save frequently** — call `save_project` after major operations
9. **Load toolsets first** — check `get_active_toolsets()` and load what you need before starting
10. **Batch for bulk** — use batch toolset for 3+ repetitive operations
